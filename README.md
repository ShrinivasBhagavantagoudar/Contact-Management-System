# Contact-Management-System

Abstract: Contact Management System


The Contact Management System is a beginner-level project designed to
demonstrate the integration of two fundamental data structures: Binary Search
Trees (BSTs) and Linked Lists. This system provides a simple and efficient way
to manage a contact list where user details are stored and managed dynamically.
The project uses a Binary Search Tree to organize contacts alphabetically by
name. Each node in the tree represents a contact, containing the contact’s name
and a pointer to a linked list. The Linked List stores multiple phone numbers
associated with each contact, allowing flexibility to handle contacts with multiple
numbers.


Key functionalities of the system include:

 Adding a Contact: A new contact is inserted into the BST while maintaining
alphabetical order.

 Searching for a Contact: Efficiently locates a contact by name in the BST
and displays its details.

 Displaying All Contacts: Displays all contacts in alphabetical order using
an in-order traversal of the BST.

 Adding Phone Numbers: Adds new phone numbers to a contact’s linked
list, enabling multiple numbers for each contact.

 Displaying Phone Numbers: Lists all phone numbers associated with a
specific contact.


This system showcases the use of hierarchical and sequential data structures to
solve practical problems, making it an ideal project for beginners learning data
structures in C programming. The project can be further enhanced with additional
features such as deleting contacts, exporting data, or integrating with a database.
