Introduction: Contact Management System

 Managing contact information is an essential task in both personal
and professional contexts. A robust and efficient contact
management system ensures that users can store, retrieve, and
organize contact details seamlessly. This project, Contact
Management System, is designed as a beginner-friendly
implementation using two fundamental data structures: Binary
Search Trees (BSTs) and Linked Lists.
 The system aims to provide a structured way to store contact
names and their associated phone numbers. Contacts are organized
in a Binary Search Tree to ensure quick and efficient searching,
insertion, and traversal. For each contact, a Linked List is used to
manage multiple phone numbers, enabling flexibility in handling
contacts with more than one number.
 In this system:
 Binary Search Tree (BST): Contacts are stored as nodes in a BST,
sorted alphabetically by their names.
 The tree structure ensures efficient insertion, search, and traversal of
contacts, enabling quick access to the required data.
 Linked List for Phone Numbers: Each contact node contains a
linked list that stores all phone numbers associated with that
contact.
 This setup allows flexibility in handling contacts with multiple
numbers while keeping memory usage efficient.

Purpose:
 The project introduces and demonstrates:
 The practical application of Binary Search Trees for hierarchical
data management.
 The use of Linked Lists for managing variable-length data
dynamically.
